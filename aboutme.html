            <h2>Personal interests</h2>
            <pr>
                I grew up watching an playing soccer. My dad was a professional player in the Guatemalan league.<br>
                Now I also share the same passion as him. I play as a goalie, never played club or high school though.<br>
                I am a huge F.C. Barcelona fan and I went to Barcelona and watch them live for the first time.<br><br>
                
                I also enjoy cooking. I grew up with two great cooks, my mom and her mom. Even though they would never <br>
                let me be int he kitchen while they were cooking, I wanted to be around to see what they were making.<br>
                I would even tried to guess what they were making depending on how the house smelled like.<br><br>

                Recently, I have been wanting to collect retro consoles. I remember how fun it was to play on my <br>
                Nnintendo 64, Play Station 2 and my cousin's Game Cube. So far, I have been able to get my hands on to<br>
                a Game Cube with a couple of games, a PSP and a PSVita. I am wanting to get a PS2 next.
